                <h2>Explore Mongolia!</h2>
                <p> Mongolia is an endless beauty begging to be explored. The culture is rich and the traditions are intriguing. You
                    may be one plane ticket away from the greatest adventure of your life but, are you carrying the knowledge of
                    Mongolian culture and traditions with you before you go? While exploring a new culture and learning new things for
                    the first time is an enjoyable experience, it could be much more enjoyable if you have some basic information
                    under your belt before you go. Speaking the language, knowing the geography, or knowing where you will sleep are
                    all reasonable things to have planned for before you go. But have you familiarized yourself with what makes the
                    Mongolian people think the way they think or do the things they do? A wise Mongolian man once told me, "if you
                    don't know the culture of the people then you will appear to them like a clueless donkey". Do you want to be a
                    "clueless donkey" or would you rather step into a Mongolian home and know the customs and greetings needed to not
                    offend anyone. By reading through my simple Mongolia culture and traditions guide, not only will you know more and
                    gather a greater appreciation, the people of the great country of Mongolia will appreciate the time you spent
                    learning more about their country.</p>
