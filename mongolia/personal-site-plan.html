      Mongolia is an endless beauty begging to be explored. The culture is rich and the traditions are intriguing. You
      may be one plane ticket away from the greatest adventure of your life but, are you carrying the knowledge of
      Mongolian culture and traditions with you before you go? While exploring a new culture and learning new things for
      the first time is an enjoyable experience, it could be much more enjoyable if you have some basic information
      under your belt before you go. Speaking the language, knowing the geography, or knowing where you will sleep are
      all reasonable things to have planned for before you go. But have you familiarized yourself with what makes the
      Mongolian people think the way they think or do the things they do? A wise Mongolian man once told me, "if you
      don't know the culture of the people then you will appear to them like a clueless donkey". Do you want to be a
      "clueless donkey" or would you rather step into a Mongolian home and know the customs and greetings needed to not
      offend anyone. By reading through my simple Mongolia culture and traditions guide, not only will you know more and
      gather a greater appreciation, the people of the great country of Mongolia will appreciate the time you spent
      learning more about their country.

    <h3>Traditional Mongolian Food</h3>
    <p>
      Mongolian Traditional food is composed of mainly meat and milk. The milk is either made into a yogurt, fermented, or made into hard curds to chew on. 
      A popular dish that you will be served at every home is called, buuz. Buuz is a steamed mutton dumpling.
      The main delicacy of Mongolia is the sheeps head. They will literally chop off the head of a sheep, then they will blowtourch the hair. After this, they will scrape the burnt hair off with a knife then boil the head then eat it. 
      In Monogolia, they drink only hot liquids because they believe if you drink somethinig cold, you will get a sore throat. 
      The national beverage is fermented horse milk wich taste like a milky beer.
