      Mongolia is an endless beauty begging to be explored. The culture is rich and the traditions are intriguing. You
      may be one plane ticket away from the greatest adventure of your life but, are you carrying the knowledge of
      Mongolian culture and traditions with you before you go? While exploring a new culture and learning new things for
      the first time is an enjoyable experience, it could be much more enjoyable if you have some basic information
      under your belt before you go. Speaking the language, knowing the geography, or knowing where you will sleep are
      all reasonable things to have planned for before you go. But have you familiarized yourself with what makes the
      Mongolian people think the way they think or do the things they do? A wise Mongolian man once told me, "if you
      don't know the culture of the people then you will appear to them like a clueless donkey". Do you want to be a
      "clueless donkey" or would you rather step into a Mongolian home and know the customs and greetings needed to not
      offend anyone. By reading through my simple Mongolia culture and traditions guide, not only will you know more and
      gather a greater appreciation, the people of the great country of Mongolia will appreciate the time you spent
      learning more about their country.

    <h3>Traditional Mongolian Food</h3>
    <p>
      Food is one of the biggest parts of Mongolian culture.
      Mongolian food is mostly meat that has a gamey flavor to it. It's not the most flavorful food and can be hard to consume at times.
      If you reject or refuse to eat food given to you from a Mongolia, it is seen as extremly rude. 
      The best thing to do if you are having a hard time eating the food is to eat it very slow and they won't refill your bowl. 
      Traditional Mongolian food is composed of mainly meat and milk. The milk is either made into a yogurt, 
      fermented, or made into hard curds to chew on. A popular dish that you will be served at every home is called, buuz. Buuz is a steamed mutton dumpling.
      The main delicacy of Mongolia is the sheeps head. They will literally chop off the head of a sheep, then they will blowtourch the hair.
      After this, they will scrape the burnt hair off with a knife then boil the head then eat it. 
      In Monogolia, they drink only hot liquids because they believe if you drink somethinig cold, you will get a sore throat. 
      The national beverage is fermented horse milk wich taste like a milky beer. 
      It's very hard to come by fruit or vegetables at a persons home. Your best option is to buy them from a local store. However, they can be rather expensive. 
      There is a wide variety of Mongolian sweets which are mainly russian assorted choclates!

    <h3>Traditional Mongolian Home</h3>
    <p>
      The Mongolian home is the center of the Mongolian lifestyle. 
      If somebody wants to understand Mongolia better, they must visit a Mongolian home. 
      Mongolian homes are traditionally and most commonly found as Gers (yurts) which are small tent-like structures. 
      These structures are usually small and you have to duck down low in order to enter the front door. 
      Here are some general rules to follow when it comes to being in a Mongolian Ger:
      The new guest Person entering has to come in the ger first
      If you trip on the door frame walking in, it means the family will have a lot of good things.
      If you trip while walking out, someone important or something important will be lost or a bad
      thing will happen. If you accidentally do this, you walk back in and grab a piece of wood next to the stove. Then,
      place it into the stove. If you do this the bad stuff won't happen.
      Never walk out of the house with a bag on your back. Hold it beside you when you exit. If
      you have the bag on, it means.
      Never walk through the center columns in the Ger.
      All ger doors face down south towards China. Looking down on them.
      If you go to a ger that had nobody, you can make yourself some food just be sure to clean up and leave a gift
      Nevertalk through a ger door!
