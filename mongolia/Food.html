            Mongolian Traditional food is composed of mainly meat and milk. The milk is either made into a yogurt, fermented, or made into hard curds to chew on. 
            A popular dish that you will be served at every home is called, buuz. Buuz is a steamed mutton dumpling.
            The main delicacy of Mongolia is the sheeps head. They will literally chop off the head of a sheep, then they will blowtourch the hair. After this, they will scrape the burnt hair off with a knife then boil the head then eat it. 
            In Monogolia, they drink only hot liquids because they believe if you drink somethinig cold, you will get a sore throat. 
            The national beverage is fermented horse milk wich taste like a milky beer.
